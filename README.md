# E-Shop App

The aim of this CRA is to make a multipage fake virtual store to put my learning to use. Having just learnt React and the fundamentals I see this as a great
opportunity test my comprehension of the React ecosystem.


I will also be learning & applying tailwindcss and Typescript.js for the first time.

## Key features of the Website

Fetch and display products
User Authentication
"Purchasing" items
Order history recorded and stored in firebase storage upon "purchase"

## React fundamentals applied:

State __
Props
Context
Hooks
React Router v6
Render Props
React Children


### Skills/programs learnt and applied during this project

Typescript 
Tailwindcss
Redux
Firebase:
  - Database
  - Authentication
Cloudinary 


## EDIT
** Though it isn't a live e-commerce shop, it is quite possible in the near future that this app ships to production. For that matter, during the building 
phase of this App I decided to implement features required in live deployed apps such as user authentication and databases.
