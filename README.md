The aim of this CRA is to make a fake virtual store to put my learning to use. Having just learnt React and the fundamentals I see this as a great
opportunity test my comprehension of the React ecosystem.

I will also be learning & applying tailwindcss and Typescript.js for the first time.

## Key features of the Website

Fetch and display products
User Authentication
"Purchasing" items
Animated transitions
Order history recorded and stored in firebase storage upon "purchase"

## React fundamentals applied:

- State
- Props
- Context
- Hooks
- React Router v6
- Render Props
- React Children


## Skills/programs learnt and applied during this project:

- Typescript 
- Tailwindcss
- Redux toolkit
- Firebase:
  - Database
  - Authentication
- Cloudinary 
- Framer Motion


## Improvements to make:

- Store images in firestore
- ~~Add lazy loading to improve performance~~ - complete
- Add another section to the landing page
- Add favourite function to product items
- Store fake order history and favourited items in firebase database
- Display order history and favourited items for users with accounts

## EDIT
** Though it isn't a live e-commerce shop, it is quite possible in the near future that this app ships to production. For that matter, during the building 
phase of this App I decided to learn and implement features required in live deployed apps such as user authentication and databases.
